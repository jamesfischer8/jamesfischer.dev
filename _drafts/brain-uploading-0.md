We broke inertia's hold, but our bodies still craved the old chains.

Some of the subjective experience was immediately imaginable. It was the difference between walking in a swimming pool versus thin air, but reversed and multiplied. Muscles accustomed to inertial resistance wildly overshoot. Breathing becomes unstable.

Blood responds too quickly to cardiac impulse, so heartbeats become erratic. Blood sloshes through the veins. Critical organs, including the brain, lose blood flow.

The brain becomes vulnerable to a turn of the head. The fluid surrounding it no longer cushions it against sudden moves. The inner ear responds too quickly to movement, causing overwhelming vertigo.

Any neurons still alive are in chaos. Neurotransmitters careen through synapses too fast. It is a flock of starlings ripping itself apart. Cascading misfires lock up the nervous system, preventing any voluntary or involuntary muscle movement. Waning brain activity crackles offline.

After death, tissues break down quickly. Before organs can decay individually at their own rates, cellular barriers fail more uniformly. Except for bone, which retains its structure for now, tissues homogenize into a loose collection of indistinct cellular material.

It's not hard to understand why we had to abandon our bodies.

Free from our biological fragility, it would be easy to approach the speed of light. It would became possible to travel between stars in subjective days. As machines, it would be possible to compensate for the altered physics.

A few subjective days of travel, however, could be centuries back home. The people who stayed behind would age and die.

In the first, slow age of exploration, arks carried generations across light years. There was no return trip for the people on board. Those born late enough to arrive on their new world could turn around immediately and only their descendants would be alive to see their ancestral homeworld.

In the relativistic age of exploration, return was possible. The world one returned to, though, will have lived much longer. Time ravaged the body regardless of inertia. Cells under completely normal inertia still failed. Organic matter still decayed. It just happened over decades.

This, too, was an effect of our biological form. Whether it was time or distance, our nature limited us to the local.

The choice was clear. We could stay human or we could have the stars.
