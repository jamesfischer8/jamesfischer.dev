## Commit Message Subject Line Conventions

This repository uses the following conventions for commit message subject
lines:

- Use a simple, short, natural language sentence.
- Write in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature", not "Added feature").
- Use sentence casing (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).
- Avoid scope prefixes (e.g., omit things like "feat(...):").
- Keep it concise (ideally under 50 characters).
