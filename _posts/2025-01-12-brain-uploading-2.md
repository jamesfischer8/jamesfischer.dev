Luc dreamed his father died in fire.

At night, he sometimes left open the line to his biological mind to experience its dreams. The mind's strange credence for dreams still came through, which made them fun to manipulate and see how they adapted.

He lit a candle by waving his hand over it. He put his hand back over it and waited. He felt no pain, no sensation at all. He twisted his hand around and raised it, transforming the candle into an all-engulfing fire. Flames writhed all around him and still he could not feel it. He could force the pain to become part of the dream, but the recreational value of the experience came from being surprised by his sleeping mind. The fire rose above him. Ash fell from the sky. Luc looked through the churning flames and saw an incinerated landscape. That was something, at least. He stretched his arms away from him and then swept them forward, collecting the fire into a single, tall column. It stayed contained as if in a glass box.

For an instant, he thought he saw someone in the flames. Reviewing the memory, he couldn't quite tell whether he was imagining it. Then it happened again. It was his father. The fire bent into his shape.

"I don't have much time, Luc," he said.

Then he vanished. The flames returned to uncontrolled writhing.

Luc hesitated there for a moment, and then disconnected. He wanted an interesting response, not this...noise. He'd had enough of his dreams for now.

He returned to a broadsheet while his body rested in his dark bedroom. It was a large room with a black marble floor. One of its sides was open to the night air, a balcony overlooking a waterfall. Fireflies hovered over potted plants and the crickets and frogs and other creatures below made the wild sound of a forest at night.

The news told him a representative body for the workers on his planet had decided to vote on whether to declare itself a government. It had happened once before, 12 years ago. He'd used violence to quell it that time. In hindsight, it may have been a mistake. It was completely effective at removing the problem, but may have indirectly caused this re-offense. A family member of the last movement's leader led this one.

His anger at their naked corruption had driven him to overreact. This time, he knew better. He would give them what they wanted rather than what they asked for.

He'd been on Eureda for almost 20 years. It had been an unspoiled world, for the most part. A small colony predated his presence by a couple hundred years. Eight thousand people landed on a generation ship which then came apart and became the heart of their settlement. Their ancestors didn't know for certain that it would work. They took a leap. When Luc arrived two centuries later, the colony had grown to around 450 thousand people. His arrival was only the second time the colony had had outside contact.

To them, he was almost a god. He had transformed their world into an industrial planet. Only a few hundred of the colonists had ever seen him.

Today, he would descend and meet with the important members of the movement. This time, he'd try to make it work in his favor. The workers' representatives were just people. They had needs and wants like anyone else. He summoned research about each of them. He reviewed and strategized. Daylight broke, shining on his bedroom ceiling first, colored by the curtains in some places.

He reopened the connection to his biological mind. This time, the immersion was total. His full self felt like a mere extension. He stirred. His dreams had continued apart from his virtual consciousness. They slipped away from him as he tried to recall them. The integration was disorienting, despite its apparent seamlessness.

A system message surfaced in his mind. Passive security systems identified an unexpected change in his Linear Upload Consciousness Integration Driver. His dream interface had been hacked.
