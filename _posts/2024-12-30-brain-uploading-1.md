Inertia posed difficulties for traveling between stars, but with the arrival of
inertia dampers, the challenge shifted to surviving without it.

Some of the subjective experience is immediately imaginable. It is the
difference between walking in a swimming pool versus thin air, but reversed and
multiplied. Muscles accustomed to inertial resistance wildly overshoot. Even
breathing becomes unstable.

On a smaller scale, the failures are more complex. The brain becomes vulnerable
to a turn of the head. The fluid surrounding it no longer cushions it against
sudden moves. The inner ear responds too quickly to movement, causing
overwhelming vertigo.

Blood responds too quickly to cardiac impulse. Heartbeats become erratic. Blood
sloshes through the veins. Critical organs, including the brain, lose blood
flow.

Any neurons still alive are in chaos. Charged particles careen through cell
gates too fast. Cascading misfires lock up the nervous system, preventing any
voluntary or involuntary muscle movement. Waning brain activity crackles
offline.

After death, tissues break down quickly. Before organs can decay individually
at their own rates, cellular barriers fail more uniformly. Except for bone,
which retains its structure for now, tissues homogenize into a loose collection
of indistinct cellular material.

So you see, it's not hard to understand why we had to abandon our bodies.
