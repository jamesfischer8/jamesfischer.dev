We broke inertia's hold, but our bodies still craved the old chains.

Some of the subjective experience is immediately imaginable. It is the
difference between walking in a swimming pool versus thin air, but reversed and
multiplied. Muscles accustomed to inertial resistance wildly overshoot.
Breathing becomes unstable.

Blood responds too quickly to cardiac impulse. Heartbeats become erratic. Blood
sloshes through the veins. Critical organs, including the brain, lose blood
flow.

The brain becomes vulnerable to a turn of the head. The fluid surrounding it no
longer cushions it against sudden moves. The inner ear responds too quickly to
movement, causing overwhelming vertigo.

Any neurons still alive are in chaos. Charged particles careen through cell
gates too fast. A flock of starlings ripping itself apart. Cascading misfires
lock up the nervous system, preventing any voluntary or involuntary muscle
movement. Waning brain activity crackles offline.

After death, tissues break down quickly. Before organs can decay individually
at their own rates, cellular barriers fail more uniformly. Except for bone,
which retains its structure for now, tissues homogenize into a loose collection
of indistinct cellular material.

So it's not hard to understand why we had to abandon our bodies.
