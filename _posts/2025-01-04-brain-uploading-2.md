A few subjective days of travel can be centuries back home. The people who
stayed behind age and die.

Slipping inertia's yoke didn't change that.

In the first age of expansion, arks had carried generations across light years.
There was no return trip for the people on board. Those born late enough to
arrive on their new world could turn around immediately and only their
descendants would be alive to see their ancestral homeworld.

In our time, return was possible. The world one returned to, though, will have
lived much longer. Time ravaged the body regardless of inertia. Cells under
completely normal inertia still failed. Organic matter still decayed. It just
happened over decades.

Inertia damping meant long-distance travel was no longer a life sentence for
the passengers, but it still was for those they left behind.

This, too, was a limitation of our biological form.
