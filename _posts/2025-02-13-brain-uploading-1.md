Luc dreamed his father died in fire.

At night, he sometimes left open a line to his biological mind to experience its dreams. The mind's strange credence for dreams made them entertaining to manipulate and experience as they adapted to his changes.

There was a candle in the dark, lit by waving his hand. He held his hand above it and waited for the pain. Instead, he felt no sensation at all. He turned his hand palm-up and raised it, transforming the candle into an all-engulfing fire. Flames writhed all around him. No pain, still. He could force the feeling into the dream, but the recreational value of the experience came from being surprised by his sleeping mind. The fire rose above him. Ash fell from the sky. Luc looked through the churning flames and saw an incinerated landscape. That was something, at least. He stretched his arms away from him and then swept them forward, collecting the fire into a single, tall column. It stayed contained as if in a glass box.

For an instant, he thought he saw someone in the flames. Reviewing the memory, he couldn't quite tell whether he had imagined it. Then it happened again. It was his father. The fire bent into his shape. Tall, motionless, hands clasped calmly behind his back. Luc could imagine him asking questions about a failed negotiation from ancient history, guiding Luc to realize an ancestor's fatal error so that the family would not repeat the mistake. It was their responsibility alone to protect the future.

"I don't have much time, Luc," he said. His voice was just as steady and precise as it always was, but this particular sequence of words Luc had not heard from his father until now.

*What is it?* Luc wanted to ask. He almost had the first word out of his mouth.

Then his father vanished. The flames returned to uncontrolled writhing.

Luc hesitated there for a moment, and then disconnected. He wanted an interesting response from his sleeping mind to his actions, not this...noise. He'd had enough of his dreams for now.

He returned to a broadsheet while his body rested in his dark bedroom. It was a large room with a black marble floor. One of its sides was open to the night air, a balcony overlooking a waterfall. Fireflies hovered over potted plants and the crickets and frogs and other creatures below made the wild sound of a forest at night.

The news told him a representative body for the workers on his planet had decided to vote on whether to declare itself a government. This had happened once before, over a decade ago. He'd used violence to quell it that time. In hindsight, the solution may have been a mistake. It was completely effective at removing the problem, but it may have indirectly caused this re-offense. A family member of the last movement's leader led this one.

His anger at their naked corruption had driven him to overreact. This time, he knew better. He would give them what they wanted rather than what they asked for.

He'd been on Eureda for almost 20 years. It had been an unspoiled world, for the most part. A small colony predated his presence by a couple hundred years. Eight thousand people landed on a generation ship which then came apart and became the heart of their settlement. Their ancestors didn't know for certain that it would work. They took a leap. When Luc arrived two centuries later, the colony had grown to around 450 thousand people. His arrival was only the second time the colony had had outside contact.

Under his direction, their colony flourished into an industrial wonder. Only a few hundred of the colonists had ever seen him. To them, he was almost a god.

Today, he would descend and meet with the important members of the new movement. This time, he'd try to get a better outcome in the long-term. He thought through his options. The workers' representatives were just people. They had needs and wants like anyone else. With a thought, he summoned research about each of them. Daylight broke, shining on his bedroom ceiling first, colored by the curtains in some places.

He reopened the connection to his biological mind. This time, the immersion was total. His full self became a mere extension. He stirred. His dreams had continued apart from his virtual consciousness. They slipped away from him as he tried to recall them. The integration was made to feel seamlessness, but he felt a strange sense of disorientation in the first moments after being reunited with himself.

An alert surfaced in his mind. Passive security systems had identified an unexpected change in his Liminal Unified Consciousness Integration Driver. His dream interface had been hacked.
